Project title - 
    Care Connect

what and why- 
    The software System we would like to build this semster is a health app that allows patients to schedlue appoiments with doctors and allow nureses and doctors to find a time slot for the patients and upadte the patients's data after their visit. This app would streamline healthcare for the patients since it will be easier and more time efficent to schedule time to go to the hospital. People usally put off hospital visits because of the hassle of making an appoiment and that could be detrimental to their health.


For whom- 
    The software are for people who want to make appoiments with their hospital, but dont have time to visit in person to setup their appoiment. The software is also for doctors or nurses to keep track of user information and check when their patients want to shcedule an appoiment with them and a breif description of the problem the patients is facing 

How-
