## Project Title  
**Care Connect**  

---

## What and Why  
We propose building **Care Connect**, a healthcare scheduling and management system designed to streamline patient-doctor interactions.  

Currently, patients often delay hospital visits due to the hassle of booking appointments, which can negatively impact their health. Care Connect addresses this problem by allowing patients to easily schedule appointments online while enabling doctors and nurses to efficiently manage availability and update patient records.  

This system reduces administrative friction, improves time efficiency, and enhances patient care by making healthcare access more convenient.

## For Whom  
Care Connect is designed for two main groups:  

1. **Patients** – Individuals who want a convenient way to book hospital or clinic appointments without visiting in person or making multiple phone calls.  
2. **Healthcare Staff (Doctors & Nurses)** – Medical professionals who need an organized system to manage patient appointments, review cases ahead of time, and update patient records seamlessly.

## How It Works  
From the end-user perspective:  

- **Patients**  
  - Create an account or log in.  
  - Submit/update their personal health information.  
  - Browse available time slots (up to three months in advance) based on doctors’ schedules.  
  - Schedule an appointment and provide a brief description of their health concern.  

- **Healthcare Staff (Admins, Doctors, Nurses)**  
  - Input availability and manage schedules.  
  - Receive notifications when patients create appointments.  
  - Access automatically generated reports with appointment details, patient context, and instructions.  
  - Update patient records after visits.  

This design ensures a **seamless workflow** across patients and staff, minimizing redundant communication and enabling better preparation for each appointment.

## Scope  
This project is designed to be flexible in scale:  

- At a **minimum viable level**, Care Connect will support patient scheduling and basic administrative management—achievable within one semester by a small team.  
- With additional development time, the system can evolve into a **market-ready product** with extended features (e.g., reminders, telemedicine integration, advanced analytics).  

We plan to work in **Agile sprints**, iteratively implementing features for each user group. This approach ensures the project remains achievable within the semester while allowing room for enhancements if time permits.
